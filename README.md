# Microsoft Outlook manipulation with win32com (Python)

Welcome to your journey into discovering the magical world of your emails. ðŸ˜„ If you're here I assume you're interested in email analytics and automations.

ðŸš§ I revisited this project after 2 years and a lot has changed. The new Outlook is a web application utilizing Microsoft Graph which makes the old code base (seen below) obsolete and useless.
I'm working on releasing 2 courses here focusing on both versions. I'm planning to add Jupyter Notebook examples where I'll explain more what's going on in the code.
ðŸš§

This will always be the first thing to do when interacting with your Outlook on your computer:

```python
import win32com.client
outlook = win32.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application").GetNamespace("MAPI")
```
You can decide which path to take to continue.
1.) The standard path where you choose the default folder.
```python
root_folder = outlook.GetDefaultFolder(6)
```

<b>OR</b> the custom path where you decide and deliberately choose which email address to use.
2.)
```python
root_folder = outlook.Folders(1).Items
messages = root_folder.Folders.Item(1) # this should be the incoming messages folder
```
You can also you the exact name of the folder. For example:
3.)
```python
root_folder = outlook.Folders('Inbox').Items
```

Let's take number 2.) because it gives us more control over our script/program. 

#TODO:

Looping through folders:
```python
for folder in root_folder.Folders:
  print(folder.Name)
 ```

 #TODO:
 - accessing parts of messages (Sender.Name, SenderEmailAddress, Body, etc.)
 - loop through messages
 - loop thorugh messages based on certain conditions
 - loop through messages and download attachments
 - loop through messsages and download certain attachments
 - writing and sending email (inserting pictures and attachments)

All of the above is coming soon!
